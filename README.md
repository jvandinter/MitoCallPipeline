# Overview

The pipeline described here calls mitochondrial SNVs and small indels in hg38 WGS BAM files. Additional filtering is supplied in functions for R. 

This pipeline is originally created by the [GATK](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-mitochondria-pipeline) and slightly modified by me.


## Using the pipeline

A step-by-step tutorial is provided on a vignette [here](https://github.com/jvandinter/MitoCallPipeline/vignette/).
